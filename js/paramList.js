In the presence of clouds (which release additional buoyancy aloft, creating cloudsuck) the updraft top will be above this forecast, but the maximum thermalling height will then be limited by the cloud base. Further, when the mixing results from shear turbulence rather than thermal mixing this parameter is not useful for glider flying.

Specifically, it gives the expected increase of a BL Top height based on a Thermal Index (TI) = 0 criteria should the actual surface temperature be 4 Â°F warmer than forecast.  Larger values indicate greater uncertainty/variability and thus better thermalling over local 'hot spots' or small-scale topography not resolved by the model.  But larger values also indicate greater sensitivity to error in the predicted surface temperature, so actual conditions have a greater likelihood of differing from those predicted.  Small values often result from the presence of a stable (inversion) layer capping and limiting thermal growth.  This parameter is most easily utilized through relative values, i.e. by first determining a 'typical' value for a location and subsequently noting whether predictions for a given day are for more/less uncertainty than is typical."],

If CAPE is also large, thunderstorms can be triggered.  Negative convergence (divergence) produces subsiding vertical motion, creating low-level inversions which limit thermalling heights.
